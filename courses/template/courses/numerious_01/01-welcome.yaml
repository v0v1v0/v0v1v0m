      <p>
          You’ve just logged onto your computer for the first time as a new remote employee at Numerious Inc. 
          After booting up, you receive a meeting invitation from the CEO of Numerious.
      </p>

      <p><strong>The CEO appears on your screen and begins speaking:</strong></p>
      
      <blockquote>
          <p>
          "Welcome to Numerious! We are thrilled to have you on board. I'm sorry your manager couldn’t join us today. 
          It’s a bit unusual that they aren’t here, but I’ll catch them up later."
          </p>
          <p>
          "At Numerious, our vision is to become the world leader in advanced analytics for solving complex business 
          problems. Our mission is to equip businesses with actionable insights through robust, unbiased analysis."
          </p>
          <p>
          "As part of our team, you’ll be working on important projects that transform data into strategic decisions for our clients. 
          You’ll need to understand how to handle data, perform in-depth analysis, and deliver insights that drive business growth."
          </p>
          <p>
          "In the coming weeks, you'll be diving into our training program. This will cover everything you need to know—from 
          data wrangling to advanced statistical models—to become proficient in our methodologies. But don't worry, 
          we'll guide you through each step."
          </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
          As the CEO continues to speak, she goes on to explain that you’ll be expected to contribute to the company’s goals by 
          applying data-driven solutions and keeping up with the latest in analytics technology. However, before she can finish explaining, 
          she receives an urgent phone call.
      </p>
      
      <!-- Urgent Phone Call Image -->

      <p><strong>The CEO looks startled as her phone rings:</strong></p>
      
      <blockquote>
          <p>"I’m so sorry, I have to take this urgent call."</p>
          <p>She quickly turns off her video and audio, and the screen displays a muted icon. You wait as the CEO handles the call.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>After a moment, the CEO returns, turning her video and audio back on.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
          <p>"I just received some unfortunate news—your manager had an accident and is in the hospital."</p>
          <p>"It looks like the training we had planned for today will need to be postponed."</p>
          <p>"But I need a quick insight from you. Can you log into the web app and help me pull a few data insights?"</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
          The CEO thanks you for your flexibility and encourages you to get started right away. She assures you that 
          the training will be rescheduled soon, but for now, it’s time to jump in and help.
